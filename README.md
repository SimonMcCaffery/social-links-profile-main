## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Lightbulb moment that I was not adjusting the width of the component at smaller screen sizes causing it to look incredibly squashed.

Used my first media query, all be it very simply, was still an achievment.


### Continued development

Further use of media queries at different breakpoints to enchance responsivness.

Developing for mobile devices first 

ux principles for sizing at smaller screen sizes


### Useful resources

W3Schools for simple examples of media queries that were easy to understand and create my own.
